## About Us

KicksKart was founded in 2015 by a group of sneaker enthusiasts who wanted to create a platform where collectors and casual buyers alike could find authentic footwear. What started as a small operation in a garage has now grown into one of the leading online marketplaces for premium sneakers. Over the years, KicksKart has collaborated with major brands and independent designers to bring exclusive collections to our customers.

Since our inception, we've been committed to authenticity and customer satisfaction, establishing verification centers across the country to ensure every product meets our quality standards.
